I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>samanyu6.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>samanyu6.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi there, Iâ€™m Samanyu! I love computers and enjoy building software. Iâ€™m particularly interested in distributed systems, how they work, their reliability and scalability. I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked extensively in Machine Learning, IoT and Full Stack during my college years, you can find most of my work on github.
Apart from exploring the science of computers, I really enjoy gaming, tennis and music.
